I’ve completed the 3-step registration form assignment and I’m attaching the project folder here for your review.

Here’s a quick summary of what I’ve implemented:

- A 3-step user registration form built with React and Bootstrap
- Email duplication check at the first step (using Express and MySQL)
- Backend API to save data to a MySQL database
- Error handling and validation for a smooth user experience
- Organized code structure with separate frontend and backend folders
- Used XAMPP for local database setup during development

Frontend is built with React (Vite), and backend is in Node.js using Express. The MySQL database is locally hosted.
